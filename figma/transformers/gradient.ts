/**
 * Return static Manifold branded gradients
 *
 * Note(drew): Youâ€™ve found my secret!
 *
 * This file is a little deceiving because youâ€™d think we could just pull
 * gradients from Figma. Well, itâ€™s HARD! Figma doesnâ€™t just give you the CSS
 * from the API like youâ€™d expect; they give you 2D vectors you have to
 * trigonometrize into CSS. I originally tried copying Diezâ€™ linear-gradients
 * code, but then I found a bug. ðŸ‘€ Observe:
 *
 * Figma: linear-gradient(272.4deg, #FE1360 -13.37%, #814EAE 26.05%, #2D98CC 77.38%, #FD8745 95.25%, #FDC935 135.64%)
 * Diez: linear-gradient(240deg, hsla(340.3404255319149, 99.15611814345992%, 53.529411764705884%, 1) -12%, hsla(271.875, 38.095238095238095%, 49.411764705882355%, 1) 24%, hsla(199.62264150943395, 63.85542168674698%, 48.82352941176471%, 1) 70%, hsla(21.52173913043478, 97.87234042553192%, 63.13725490196078%, 1) 86%, hsla(44.39999999999999, 98.03921568627452%, 60%, 1) 123%);
 *
 * 272.2deg !== 240deg! This is just an example; in other gradients I found the
 * values off by just enough each time it made me not want to use it.
 *
 * Until I either find an existing solution that can generate CSS from Figma
 * (currently CSS isnâ€™t accessible from Figmaâ€™s API), or I figure out a way to
 * recreate Figmaâ€™s CSS with maths, keeping static values here is less work and
 * easier to manage since these donâ€™t change very often.
